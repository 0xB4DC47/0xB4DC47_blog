            <h1>WHOAMI</h1>
            I'm a Senior Security Consultant specializing in hardware/firmware penetration testing and reverse engineering.
            My journey began with designing and programming low-level systems as an embedded systems engineer. Eventually, after realizing how much more I enjoyed 
            security, I officially made the switch to pentesting. Nowadays, I lead all sorts pentests from black-box hardware engagements to standard web pentests to AI/LLM tests. 
            I wanted a place to share the things I've learned or fun projects I'm working on, so I decided to make this website.
