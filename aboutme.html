            Welcome to my technical journal where I share my experiences and knowledge about:

            <h1>WHOAMI</h1>
            I'm a Senior Security Consultant specializing in hardware and firmware reverse engineering and penetration testing.
            My journey began with designing and programming low-level systems as a embedded systems engineer. Eventually, after realizing how much I enjoyed 
            reverse engineering and finding security flaws I officially made the switch to pentesting. Nowadays, I lead all sorts pentests from black-box hardware engagements to standard web pentests. 
            I wanted a place to share the things I've learned or fun projects I've worked on, so I decided to make this website.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I’m not working, I occasionally find myself working on personal projects (probably for this site) including: tinkering with electronics, reverse-engineering,
            or competing in a CTF. Outside of that, I’ll probably be playing the drums, gaming, or learning a language.
